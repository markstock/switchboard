# switchboard
Render a visual representation of the load on a supercomputer

## Build and run
You should be able to build and run the code with:

	make
	./switchboard nodelist1

## To do
* Finish the nodelist-parsing code
* Create a system to generate a never-ending list of colors, use the ryb system, ensure each additional color is far away from all others
* generalize the box-sizing code to any number of levels in a hierarchy
* read the nodelist from the stdin
* complete the code to convert actual node ids to zero-indexed ids
* read command line args to set some of these figures, specify an output filename

## Thanks
